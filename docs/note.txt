for py script, define variables for local paths and set them at the top with imports
with a warning to let people know to change them to their respective local dir
May consider "config" txt also


Update: 
No, we are using os path
can still consider a config file for other purposes (maybe xtts checkpoint and vocab)

Update 26/01/2025:
If doing different models (or even just one)- an init script that sets up the file paths for model files like (foundation checkpoints, vocab files, modules or fine-tunes).
