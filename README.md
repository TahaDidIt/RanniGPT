# RanniGPT

A Text-To-Speech narrator tool that allows for easy inference with custom user voice models and robust quality speech generation.
The project currently aims to support XTTS and RVC voice engines, with potentiatl for some kind of LLM support or integration further down the line.

The exploratory research and logs that go into this project can be found at my [Python AI Voice Cloning](https://github.com/TahaDidIt/Python-AI-Voice-Cloning-Log) repo.





# Usage

## Features

RanniGPT is currently in an early development stage.

## Setup

Currently, the project requires XTTS from CoquiTTS, and hopefully daswer123's rvc-python library.

(I'll try to include a .yaml environment file and further instructions here later.)

## For Developers

## Credits
- CoquiAI for releasing their voice models
- Daswer123 for creating the very helpful rvc-python library, making rvc-inference a breeze
- Jarod Mica for his videos helping me get setup with RVC, and for the education on these topics
